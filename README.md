## What is it?

In this repository, I will post settings files or a text description of how to recreate convenient settings of everything that I often use (applications, services, etc.), if its settings are not saved in a file that can be simply transferred. This is all relevant for those applications and services that do not have the function of saving and synchronizing settings with an account (as is done in Google Chrome).

## Repository structure

- [OSes](./OSes/README.md)

## Language

I don't plan to translate all this into English. There will only be a README file in English.
